This file describes the variables in the output file (Final.txt).

subj_id     - Unique identifier for study subject.
activity    - Descriptive label for measured activity.
feature     - The feature that was measured - see below.
mean        - Mean of the measured feature, averaged per subject and activity.
std         - Standard deviation, averaged per subject and activity.


The following description of the features is taken from the file
features_info.txt supplied with the raw data.

As, per the raw data README.txt, the features were all normalized they, their
means and their standard  deviations are all unitless.

================================================================================
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and
gyroscope 3-axial raw signals, tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals
(prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they
were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter
with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration
signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals
(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter
with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in
time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the
magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the
Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag,
tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals
producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag,
fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain
signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each
pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
